Vimer (VIdeo transforMER) is an AI powered GUI for FFmpeg, a cross-platfom and multilanguage app with a hassle-free interface for adjusting audio and video.
<br /><br />
You just need to choose the files you want to change, describe what you want and let the artificial intelligence take care of the rest, automatically generating and executing the necessary FFmpeg commands. Forget complicated codes.
<br /><br />
Whether converting formats, adjusting quality, adding effects, adjusting audio, or mixing different media, Vimer offers a simple path to media conversion and editing without the need for advanced technical knowledge.
<br /><br />
As for security, the application exclusively executes FFmpeg commands and allows you to review the commands before executing them. This way, it allows any user without knowledge to use FFmpeg indirectly with an uncomplicated approach, making its incredible features accessible to any user without technical knowledge.
